This module has only been test on the following platforms:

        os              jdk vendor              jdk version     comments
        --              ----------              -----------     --------

linux 2.2.14            blackdown               1.1.8           o.k.

solaris 2.5.1           sun                     1.1.8           o.k.

If you get it to work on something else, and it reguires modifications to the
makefiles, send me the diffs or a description and I'll incorporate the changes
into the autoconf scripts.

NOTICE: You must use a native threads jdk version. Green threads will
not work.

To build, cd into the nsjava directory and type:

./configure --with-aolserver-src=AOLSERVER_SRC_DIR --prefix=AOLSERVER_BIN_DIR

See the configure options at the end of the INSTALL document.

The build and configure process has only been tested on redhat 6.2 and 
solaris 2.7, so if you have something different you probably will have to
modify the makefile and/or configure.in yourself. 

Before starting to build set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that libjava.so is included 
in the path.  You might also need to add the path to the libnsjava.so file.

For the 1.2.2 jdk's, I have had to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include libjava.so
libjvm.so, and libhpi.so.  This seems a little bizarre to me.  I have to wonder
if it has something to do with how I'm building libnsjava.so.  Oh well, one 
thing to add to the todo list.

Once it is configured, type `make'.

When make is complete, type `make install'.

Add the libnsjava.so entry to your list of modules in your nsd.tcl file as 
follows:

[ns/server/acs-pg/modules]
nsjava=libtclblend.so

Add another section in your nsd.tcl file for the nsjava module:

[ns/server/acs-pg/module/nsjava]
; enable the java module
EnableJava=on
; same as java command line verbose mode.  setting it to "on" will show the 
; loading of libraries in the log file.
VerboseJvm=off
; Some 1.1 jvm's segfault when destroyed.  This option can be used to bypass 
; destroying the jvm at shutdown.
DestroyJvm=off
; Prepend the following to the default classpath. This is just an example, your
; classpath will probably be different.
ClassPath=/usr/jdk118/lib/classes.zip:/web/acs-pg/www/webmail/java:/usr/local/aolserver/bin/nsjava.jar

Change the classpath to reflect the location of your java libraries.  During 
install the libnsjava.so and the nsjava.jar files are copied to the 
aolserver bin directory.  The 1.2.2 jdk's don't require the classpath to 
include the path to classes.zip or other system .jar files.
