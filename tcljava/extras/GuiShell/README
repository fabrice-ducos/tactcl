GuiShell is a java class that uses the Swing toolkit to provide
a graphical user interface to a Jacl shell. It can be used instead
of the tcl.lang.Shell class that ships with jacl. It is not included
in the regular classes because it requires the Swing toolkit to work.

To compile the GuiShell program, make sure the CLASSPATH is setup
properly and includes the Jacl jar files. Then invoke javac like so:

javac GuiShell.java

(and to run it)

java GuiShell
