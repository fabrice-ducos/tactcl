Subject: [Bug Jacl 1.1a1] expr treats "" as 0

Submitted by:  Jeffrey J. Biesiadecki
OperatingSystem:  Sun Solaris
OperatingSystemVersion:  2.5.1
Synopsis:  expr treats "" as 0

ReproducibleScript:
The command
    expr {0 == ""}
returns "1" in jacl1.1a1 using jdk1.1.3, while in Tcl8.0p2 it returns "0".
Same problem with other variations like
    expr {"" == 0}   expr {"" != 0}    expr {0x0 == ""}    etc.

ObservedBehavior:
Return value inconsistent with that of Tcl

DesiredBehavior:
Return value consistent with that of Tcl :)


expr {0 == ""}
0
(Jacl returns 1)

expr {"" == ""}
1
(Jacl returns 0)

expr {"" == 0}
0
(Jacl returns 1)
