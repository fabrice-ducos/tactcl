This message is to announce the new 1.4.1 release of Jacl and
Tcl Blend.  These releases are the result of efforts by Mo DeJong
and the Jacl and Tcl Blend user community.

The 1.4.1 release of Jacl and Tcl Blend are available for
downloading at the following URL:

    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13005

The 1.4.1 release is considered stable and is now ready for evaluation
in production environments. This release is well tested and should be
bug free.

What's New in the 1.4.1 Release?
----------------------------------

Jacl 1.4.1 includes a new compiler named TJC (Tcl to Java Compiler).
A Tcl proc compiled with TJC will execute from 10 to 30 times faster.
TJC supports both a batch compile mode and a runtime compilation mode.
Jacl's expression engine has also been significantly optimized.

Itcl has been ported to Jacl, a user need only execute
"package require Itcl" to load Itcl commands into a Jacl shell.

Class loading has been completely overhauled for both Jacl and
Tcl Blend. The class loader delagation model is now used for
all class loading. Support for inner classes has also been
improved in the java package commands.

The java package now includes a new java::for command. This
command provides a mapping to Java's enhanced for loop statement
and provides a simplified way to loop over the elements of a
Collection or array object. See the documentation for usage examples.

A new binary release of Tcl Blend is now provided for Win32 systems.
This binary release includes compiled versions of Tcl/Tk, Tcl Blend, and
a full JDK 1.4.

See the included documentation for more information about new
features in this release.

What is Jacl?
----------------

Jacl is a 100% Java implementation of Tcl 8. This allows Tcl to run
in more environments and also brings the power of scripting to Java
developers. Jacl implements almost all the features available in
the C version of Tcl and is well tested.

What is Tcl Blend?
------------------------

Tcl Blend is a Tcl Extension that allows a developer access to the
Java VM from the Tcl interpreter. A developer can script Java
code from Tcl or write new Tcl extensions in Java instead of C/C++.
A developer can also load both Tcl and Tcl Blend into an existing
Java JVM. Tcl Blend is known to work on Solaris, Windows 95/NT/XP,
IRIX, and Linux. Other systems have not been tested but it should
be easy to port Tcl Blend to any system that supports dynamic
loading and the Java JNI interface.
